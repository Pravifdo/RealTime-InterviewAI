# üé• HOW TO JOIN THE INTERVIEW - UPDATED INSTRUCTIONS

## Hi Anada! üëã

You were getting the error because browsers require **secure HTTPS connection** for camera/microphone when accessing from another computer.

Here's the **EASY FIX**:

---

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION: Use Chrome with Special Settings

### Step 1: Download the Script

Ask the interviewer to send you this file:
```
start-chrome-for-participant.ps1
```

Save it on your Desktop.

### Step 2: Close ALL Chrome Windows

Make sure Chrome is completely closed (check taskbar).

### Step 3: Run the Script

1. Right-click on `start-chrome-for-participant.ps1`
2. Click **"Run with PowerShell"**

**Or** open PowerShell and run:
```powershell
cd Desktop
.\start-chrome-for-participant.ps1
```

### Step 4: Enter the Interview Link

The script will ask for the interview link. Paste:
```
http://192.168.107.175:3000/joinParticipant?room=room-gmh12sxpr
```

Press Enter.

### Step 5: Join the Interview

1. Chrome will open automatically with the interview page
2. Click **"Join Interview Room"** button
3. Click **"Allow"** when asked for camera and microphone permissions
4. You're connected! üéâ

## üîç ALTERNATIVE METHOD (If Script Doesn't Work)

### Manual Chrome Start:

1. Close ALL Chrome windows

2. Press `Windows + R` to open Run dialog

3. Copy and paste this **entire line**:
   ```
   "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure="http://192.168.107.175:3000" --user-data-dir="%LOCALAPPDATA%\ChromeDevSession"
   ```

4. Press Enter

5. In the Chrome that opens, go to:
   ```
   http://192.168.107.175:3000/joinParticipant?room=room-gmh12sxpr
   ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES

   - Exit this Chrome when interview is done
   - Open regular Chrome for other work

3. **Security is fine**
   - This is safe for your local network
   - Don't use this setting for public internet sites

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Script execution is disabled"

PowerShell might block the script. Fix:

1. Open PowerShell **as Administrator**
2. Run:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```
3. Type `Y` and press Enter
4. Try running the script again

### "Chrome not found"

If Chrome is installed elsewhere:

1. Open PowerShell
2. Run:
   ```powershell
   Get-ChildItem "C:\Program Files" -Filter "chrome.exe" -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
   ```
3. Note the path
4. Edit the script and update `$chromePath` variable

### Still getting camera error?

Try Firefox instead:

1. Open Firefox
2. Type in address bar: `about:config`
3. Click "Accept the Risk and Continue"
4. Search: `media.devices.insecure.enabled`
5. Click the toggle to set it to `true`
6. Open the interview link
