## 📧 SEND HER THESE 3 THINGS

### 1. The Interview Link
```

**Option A: Batch File** (EASIEST - just double-click)
- File: `start-interview.bat`
- She just **double-clicks it** and enters the link

**Option B: PowerShell Script** (More robust)
- File: `start-chrome-for-participant.ps1`
- Right-click → Run with PowerShell

### 3. Instructions Document

**Option 1: Simple** (one page)
- File: `QUICK_START_FOR_ANADA.md`

**Option 2: Detailed** (comprehensive)
- File: `FOR_ANADA_UPDATED.md`

## 📝 QUICK MESSAGE TEMPLATE

Copy and send this via WhatsApp/Email:

```
Hi Anada,

I've attached the files you need to join the interview.

SIMPLE STEPS:
1. Download the attached "start-interview.bat" file
2. Double-click it to run
3. Paste this link when asked:
   http://192.168.107.175:3000/joinParticipant?room=room-gmh12sxpr
4. Chrome will open automatically
5. Click "Join Interview Room"
6. Allow camera and microphone
7. Done!

Why this is needed: Browsers require HTTPS for camera access over network. This script makes Chrome allow it for our testing.

If you have any issues, check the instructions file or let me know!

Make sure you're on the same Wi-Fi as me.

See you in the interview! 👍
```

**Attach:**
- `start-interview.bat` (or `start-chrome-for-participant.ps1`)
- `QUICK_START_FOR_ANADA.md` (optional, for reference)
