# 🎯 SHARE THIS WITH ANADA - SIMPLE STEPS

## Hi Anada! 👋

The link with "localhost" won't work. Use this new link instead:

---

## ✅ THE CORRECT LINK

```
http://192.168.107.175:3000/joinParticipant?room=room-gmh12sxpr
```

Copy the entire link above and paste it in your browser.

---

## 📱 BEFORE YOU CLICK THE LINK

### 1. Check Wi-Fi Connection
Make sure you're connected to the **same Wi-Fi** as me.

### 2. Test Connection (Optional)
Open Command Prompt and type:
```
ping 192.168.107.175
```

You should see something like:
```
Reply from 192.168.107.175: bytes=32 time=2ms
Reply from 192.168.107.175: bytes=32 time=1ms
```

✅ If you see "Reply" - Good! We're connected.
❌ If you see "Request timed out" - We're on different networks.
