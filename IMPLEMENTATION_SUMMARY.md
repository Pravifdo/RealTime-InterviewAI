## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes
**File:** `backend/node/server.js`

**Added:**
1. WebRTC Signaling Events
   - `join-room` - Room management
   - `offer` - WebRTC offer exchange
   - `answer` - WebRTC answer exchange
   - `ice-candidate` - ICE candidate exchange

2. Meeting Control
   - `start-meeting` - Start timer
   - `end-meeting` - End session
   - Real-time timer broadcast (every 1s)

3. State Synchronization
   - `interviewer-toggle` - Camera/mic state
   - `participant-toggle` - Camera/mic state
   - `new-question` - Question broadcasting
   - `new-answer` - Answer broadcasting

### Frontend Changes

- Automatic cleanup on unmount

#### Updated: `frontend/src/pages/JoinInterview.js`
**Changes:**
- Integrated WebRTC hook
- Added dual video display (local + remote)
- Enhanced UI with styled components
- Added connection status indicator
- Improved error handling
- Real-time state synchronization

#### Updated: `frontend/src/pages/joinParticipant.js`

- Enhanced UI with styled components
- Added connection status indicator
- Questions list with scrolling
- Improved error handling
- Real-time state synchronization

## 🎯 How It Works

### WebRTC Connection Flow
```
1. Both users open their pages
   ├─ Interviewer page
   └─ Participant page

2. Camera/Microphone permissions requested
   └─ Local media streams created

3. Join common room "interview-room"
   └─ Socket.IO room-based communication

4. WebRTC Peer Connection
   ├─ Interviewer creates offer
   ├─ Participant creates answer
   ├─ ICE candidates exchanged
   └─ Direct P2P connection established

5. Live Video Streaming
   ├─ Video flows directly between peers
   ├─ Audio flows directly between peers
   └─ Low latency, high quality
```

### State Synchronization
```
Camera Toggle:
1. User clicks camera button
2. Local video track enabled/disabled (immediate)
3. Socket.IO emits state change
4. Backend broadcasts to all clients
5. Remote peer updates status display
```

### Timer Mechanism
```
1. Interviewer clicks "Start Interview"
2. Backend sets meetingStartTime
3. setInterval broadcasts time every 1s
4. Both clients receive and display same time
5. Timer stops when meeting ends
```

## 🚀 How to Test

### Quick Test (Single Machine)
```powershell
# Terminal 1: Start backend
cd backend/node
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Start frontend
cd frontend
npm start
```

Then:
1. Open `http://localhost:3000/join-interview` in Chrome
2. Open `http://localhost:3000/join-participant` in Firefox
3. Allow camera/mic on both
4. See both video feeds appear
5. Test all features!

### Features to Test:
- ✅ Camera toggle → See status update on other side
- ✅ Mic toggle → See status update on other side
- ✅ Start meeting → Timer starts on both sides
- ✅ Send question → Appears on participant side
- ✅ Send answer → Received by interviewer
- ✅ End meeting → Both see notification
