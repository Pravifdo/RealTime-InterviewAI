- Local video shows ‚úÖ
- Remote video is black/not showing ‚ùå
- But you can see status updates (mute/unmute) ‚úÖ

This means:
- ‚úÖ Socket.IO is working (state sync works)
- ‚ùå WebRTC video stream is not displaying

## üéØ Quick Fix

### Solution 1: Restart Both Servers (Most Common Fix)

**Step 1: Stop Both Servers**
```powershell
# In both terminal windows, press: Ctrl + C
```

**Step 2: Clear Browser Cache**
```
Press: Ctrl + Shift + R (hard refresh)
Or: Ctrl + Shift + Delete ‚Üí Clear cache
```

**Step 3: Restart Backend**
```powershell
cd backend/node
npm run dev
```

Wait for:
```
‚úÖ MongoDB connected
üöÄ Server running on http://localhost:5000
```

**Step 4: Restart Frontend**
```powershell
cd frontend
npm start
```

**Step 5: Open in Browsers**
1. Interviewer: `http://localhost:3000/join-interview`
2. Participant: `http://localhost:3000/join-participant`
3. Allow camera/mic on both

## üîç Debugging Steps

### Check Browser Console

**Open DevTools** (F12) and look for these messages:

#### ‚úÖ What You SHOULD See:
```
Creating peer connection...
Adding local tracks to peer connection
Adding track: video
Adding track: audio
Socket ljKnKo2h joined room interview-room
User joined: xyz123
Starting call as initiator
Sending offer
Received offer
Sending answer
üé• Received remote track: video
üé• Received remote track: audio
Remote streams: [MediaStream]
Setting remote video stream to element
Remote stream tracks: [MediaStreamTrack, MediaStreamTrack]
Connection state: connected
```

#### ‚ùå Problems to Look For:

**Problem 1: No local stream**
```
No local stream available when creating peer connection!
```
**Fix:** Local stream not ready. Wait and retry.

**Problem 2: No remote track received**
```
// Missing: "üé• Received remote track"
```
**Fix:** WebRTC connection failed. Check network/firewall.

**Problem 3: Connection failed**
```
Connection state: failed
ICE connection state: failed
```
**Fix:** NAT/firewall issue. Try on same network.

## üõ†Ô∏è Solutions by Error Type

### Error Type 1: "Waiting for local stream..."

**Cause:** Local camera not ready when WebRTC starts

**Fix:**
1. Close both pages
2. Refresh browser (Ctrl + Shift + R)
3. Open Participant page FIRST
4. Wait 2 seconds
5. Then open Interviewer page
6. Allow camera/mic on both

### Error Type 2: No "Received remote track" message

**Cause:** WebRTC negotiation failed

**Fix:**
```powershell
# Check backend terminal for:
Socket xyz joined room interview-room
```

If you DON'T see "joined room", then:
1. Restart backend server
2. Hard refresh browser pages

### Error Type 3: "Remote stream is null"

**Cause:** Peer connection not established

**Fix:**
1. Make sure BOTH users are in the SAME room
2. Check backend logs for room joining
3. Verify both pages show "‚óè Connected" badge

## üìã Step-by-Step Debug Process

### Step 1: Check Local Video
- [ ] Interviewer sees their own video?
- [ ] Participant sees their own video?

If NO ‚Üí Camera permission issue. Fix permissions first.

### Step 2: Check Socket Connection
- [ ] Backend shows "User connected: xyz"?
- [ ] Backend shows "joined room interview-room"?

If NO ‚Üí Socket.IO connection issue. Restart backend.

### Step 3: Check WebRTC Logs
- [ ] Console shows "Creating peer connection"?
- [ ] Console shows "Adding track: video"?
- [ ] Console shows "Sending offer" or "Received offer"?

If NO ‚Üí WebRTC not starting. Check local stream is ready.

### Step 4: Check Remote Stream
- [ ] Console shows "üé• Received remote track"?
- [ ] Console shows "Setting remote video stream to element"?

If NO ‚Üí Tracks not being sent. Check peer connection.

### Step 5: Check Video Element
- [ ] Remote video element exists in DOM?
- [ ] srcObject is set?

If NO ‚Üí React rendering issue. Refresh page.

## üéØ Most Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### Issue #1: Order of Operations
**Problem:** Participant joins before interviewer

**Fix:**
```
1. Close both pages
2. Open INTERVIEWER page first
3. Wait for local video
4. Then open PARTICIPANT page
5. Wait for connection
```

### Issue #2: Stale WebRTC Connection
**Problem:** Previous connection not cleaned up

**Fix:**
```
1. Close all browser tabs
2. Restart backend (Ctrl+C, then npm run dev)
3. Hard refresh frontend (Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. Open pages in new tabs
```

### Issue #3: Browser Cache
**Problem:** Old JavaScript code cached

**Fix:**
```
1. Press F12 (DevTools)
2. Right-click refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
```

### Issue #4: Firewall/Network
**Problem:** WebRTC ports blocked

# Stop frontend (Ctrl+C in terminal)
# Close all browser tabs
```

### Step 2: Clear Everything
```powershell

## üéØ Quick Test

### Minimal Test (Same Computer):

1. **Open Chrome:**
   - Go to: `http://localhost:3000/join-interview`
   - Allow camera
   - See your video

2. **Open Firefox:**
   - Go to: `http://localhost:3000/join-participant`
   - Allow camera
   - See your video

3. **Wait 3-5 seconds**

4. **Check:**
   - Chrome should show Firefox's video
   - Firefox should show Chrome's video
   - Both should show "‚óè Connected"

If this works ‚Üí System is working!  
If not ‚Üí Check console logs for errors
